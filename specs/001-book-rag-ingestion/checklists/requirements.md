# Specification Quality Checklist: Book Content Ingestion & Embedding

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in Functional Requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (and developer stakeholders)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (except in Constraints)

## Notes

- Initial validation passed.
- Tech stack details (Python, Cohere, Qdrant) are explicitly requested by the user and are isolated in the "Constraints & Assumptions" section.
